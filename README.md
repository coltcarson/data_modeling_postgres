# Data Modeling with Postgres (Sparkify)

The Data Modeling with Postgres project is part of the Udacity's Data Engineering program and was completed on 04/09/19. For this project, we were tasked with implementing a Postgres database and ETL pipeline to process JSON files holding user and usage data extracted from Sparkify's mobile application.

### Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and run the ETL pipeline.

    - To run the Postgres database and table creation script
        `run create_tables.py`
        
    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans the data and stored it in the database
        `run etl.py`
        
    - To test that both scripts ran correctly
        `run test.ipynb`    


### Licensing
This project is apart of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree Program, which provides initial starter code for the project.
